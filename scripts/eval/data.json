Mei's small son, Lucas, snuggled under his blanket, his eyes wide with anticipation for the bedtime story.\n\n\"Tonight,\" Mei began, \"I'm going to tell you a magical tale about a young man named Khalil, who lived in a land far away called Hong Kong.

She would later become Khalil's lyricist, helping him craft beautiful songs under the name Rulan.\"\n\nLucas listened intently, imagining the sandy beaches of Hawaii and the bustling streets of Hong Kong as Mei spoke. \"Khalil grew up surrounded by music and words, and together, they inspired him to dream big dreams,\" Mei narrated with enthusiasm. \"He admired great artists like Stevie Wonder, Musiq Soulchild, and Earth, Wind & Fire, and he vowed to bring a new sound to the land of China, blending soulful melodies that were as rich and vibrant as a rainbow after rain.\"\n\n\"And so,\" Mei said with a twinkle in her eye, \"in the magical year of 2005, Khalil's dreams began to take shape. Warner Records saw the spark in him, and they offered him a special contract. With excitement bubbling in his heart, Khalil released his very first album, marking the start of his wondrous adventure.\"\n\nAt this point, Mei paused, letting Lucas's imagination take flight. Then she added, \"Now just imagine, four albums, each like a chapter in Khalil's tale, walking hand in hand down the path of time.

The night was calm, and a gentle breeze wafted through the open window, carrying with it the scent of blooming jasmine. Mei's small son, Lucas, snuggled under his blanket, his eyes wide with anticipation for the bedtime story.\n\n\"Tonight,\" Mei began, \"I'm going to tell you a magical tale about a young man named Khalil, who lived in a land far away called Hong Kong. But Khalil wasn't from Hong Kong originally. He came from a tropical island called Hawaii, where the ocean waves danced with joy and the sun shone brightly all year round.\"\n\nMei continued, \"Khalil was born on a warm day in July, the 14th to be precise, in the year 1983. His father was a talented musician, a drummer whose beats could make anyone's feet tap to the rhythm. His mother was from Hong Kong, a wise educator whose love for words was as deep as the sea. She would later become Khalil's lyricist, helping him craft beautiful songs under the name Rulan.\"\n\nLucas listened intently, imagining the sandy beaches of Hawaii and the bustling streets of Hong Kong as Mei spoke. \"Khalil grew up surrounded by music and words, and together, they inspired him to dream big dreams,\" Mei narrated with enthusiasm. \"He admired great artists like Stevie Wonder, Musiq Soulchild, and Earth, Wind & Fire, and he vowed to bring a new sound to the land of China, blending soulful melodies that were as rich and vibrant as a rainbow after rain.\"\n\n\"And so,\" Mei said with a twinkle in her eye, \"in the magical year of 2005, Khalil's dreams began to take shape. Warner Records saw the spark in him, and they offered him a special contract. With excitement bubbling in his heart, Khalil released his very first album, marking the start of his wondrous adventure.\"\n\nAt this point, Mei paused, letting Lucas's imagination take flight. Then she added, \"Now just imagine, four albums, each like a chapter in Khalil's tale, walking hand in hand down the path of time. Soulboy (2005), This Love (2006), Wonderland (2007), Orange Moon (2008) These albums were like magic spells, spreading beautiful music across the land and filling hearts with joy.\"\n\nWith the stars shining down from the night sky, Lucas smiled, enchanted by the story of Khalil.
